### Section 1: Getting Started with Docker

Docker has emerged as a transformative technology in modern software development, enabling developers to build, ship, and run applications consistently and efficiently. In this section, we'll embark on our Docker journey by covering the basics and setting up Docker on various platforms. By the end of this section, you'll be equipped to create and run your first Docker container and explore the vast repository of container images available on Docker Hub.

#### Understanding Docker and its Core Concepts

Docker is an open-source platform that utilizes containerization technology to create lightweight, portable containers. These containers encapsulate an application and its dependencies, making them independent of the underlying host system. Docker allows developers to easily package, distribute, and deploy applications, enabling seamless scalability and reproducibility. The core concepts of Docker include images, containers, and Dockerfiles, each playing a crucial role in the containerization process.

#### Installing Docker on Different Platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux)

Before diving into Docker, we must set up the platform we'll be working on. Docker supports various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. Let's proceed with the installation steps:

**Step 1: Windows:**
- Visit the official Docker website for Windows: [https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- Download the Docker Desktop installer and follow the on-screen instructions to install Docker on your Windows machine.

**Step 2: macOS:**
- Visit the official Docker website for macOS: [https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- Download the Docker Desktop installer and follow the on-screen instructions to install Docker on your macOS machine.

**Step 3: Linux:**
- For Linux, the installation steps vary depending on the distribution. Refer to Docker's official documentation for detailed instructions: [https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

#### Docker Command-Line Basics and Essential Commands

As with any technology, understanding the command-line interface (CLI) is vital for effective usage. Docker provides a robust CLI that allows developers to interact with the Docker environment efficiently. Let's explore some essential Docker commands:

**Step 1: Pulling a Docker Image:**
- Open your terminal or command prompt.
- To pull a Docker image from Docker Hub, use the following command:

```
docker pull nginx:latest
```

This command will download the latest version of the NGINX web server image from Docker Hub to your local machine.

**Step 2: Running a Docker Container:**
- To run a Docker container, use the following command:
```
docker run -d --name my_nginx -p 80:80 nginx:latest
```
This command will create a new Docker container named "my_nginx" from the "nginx:latest" image and map port 80 of the container to port 80 of the host system.

**Step 3: Viewing Running Containers:**
- To view the list of running containers, use the following command:
```
docker ps
```
This command will display a list of all running containers along with their details.

### Creating and Running Your First Docker Container

The moment you've been waiting for! Let's create and run your very first Docker container:

**Step 1: Pulling an Image:**
- Open your terminal or command prompt.
- Let's pull a simple NGINX web server image:
```
docker pull nginx:latest
```
This command will download the latest version of the NGINX web server image from Docker Hub to your local machine.

**Step 2: Running the Container:**
- Now, let's run the NGINX container:
```
docker run -d --name my_nginx -p 80:80 nginx:latest
```
This command will create a new Docker container named "my_nginx" from the "nginx:latest" image and map port 80 of the container to port 80 of the host system.

**Step 3: Accessing the Web Server:**
- Open your web browser and navigate to [http://localhost](http://localhost). You should see the default NGINX welcome page.

### Using Docker Hub for Finding and Sharing Container Images

Docker Hub is the central repository for Docker images, offering a vast collection of pre-built container images for various applications and services. Let's explore Docker Hub:

**Step 1: Search for an Image:**
- Visit the Docker Hub website: [https://hub.docker.com/](https://hub.docker.com/)
- Use the search bar to find images for your desired application or service.

**Step 2: Pull an Image from Docker Hub:**
- Once you've found the desired image, use the "docker pull" command to pull it to your local machine.
For example, to pull the official MySQL image, you can use:
```
docker pull mysql:latest
```

**Step 3: Share Your Docker Images on Docker Hub**

Sharing your custom Docker images on Docker Hub allows you to contribute to the Docker community and make your applications or services accessible to others. Let's walk through the steps to share your Docker images on Docker Hub:

1. **Create a Docker Hub Account:**
   - If you don't have a Docker Hub account, visit the Docker Hub website: [https://hub.docker.com/](https://hub.docker.com/)
   - Click on the "Sign Up" button and follow the prompts to create a new account.

2. **Log in to Docker Hub:**
   - Once you have created your Docker Hub account, log in to Docker Hub using your credentials.

3. **Tag Your Docker Image:**
   - Before pushing your custom image to Docker Hub, tag it appropriately. The tag should follow the format `DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME/IMAGE_NAME:TAG`. Replace `DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME` with your Docker Hub username, `IMAGE_NAME` with the desired name for your image, and `TAG` with a version or label for the image.
   - For example, if your Docker Hub username is "myusername" and you want to tag your custom image as "myapp" with version "v1.0", use the following command:
     ```
     docker tag my_custom_image:latest myusername/myapp:v1.0
     ```

4. **Log in to Docker Hub from the Command Line:**
   - To push the image to Docker Hub, you must log in from the command line. Open your terminal or command prompt and use the following command:
     ```
     docker login
     ```
   - You will be prompted to enter your Docker Hub username and password.

5. **Push Your Docker Image to Docker Hub:**
   - With the image tagged and logged in to Docker Hub, you can now push the image to the repository. Use the following command:
     ```
     docker push DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME/IMAGE_NAME:TAG
     ```
   - Replace `DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME/IMAGE_NAME:TAG` with the tag you created in Step 3.

6. **Verify the Pushed Image on Docker Hub:**
   - Open your web browser and navigate to Docker Hub: [https://hub.docker.com/](https://hub.docker.com/)
   - Log in to your Docker Hub account if you haven't already.
   - Go to your profile, and you should see the repository with the pushed image listed.
    You have successfully shared your custom Docker image on Docker Hub. Now, others can easily pull and use your image for their projects. Sharing your Docker images benefits the community and facilitates collaboration and promotes the use of best practices in containerization.
