# Exploring Common Security Vulnerabilities: Unmasking Injection Attacks in ASP.NET Core

In the ever-evolving landscape of web application security, understanding and defending against common security vulnerabilities is paramount. Injection attacks are among the most prevalent and potentially devastating of these vulnerabilities. In this article, we'll explore injection attacks in the context of ASP.NET Core and learn how to safeguard our applications.

## What Are Injection Attacks?

Injection attacks are a class of security vulnerabilities where malicious data is introduced into an application, often by manipulating user inputs. The attacker's goal is to trick the application into executing unintended commands or accessing unauthorized data. Common types of injection attacks include SQL injection, command injection, CRLF injection, LDAP injection, and cross-site scripting (XSS).

## SQL Injection: A Closer Look

SQL injection (SQLi) is a well-known injection attack that targets the application's database. Attackers exploit SQLi by injecting malicious SQL code into user inputs, typically in search fields, login forms, or any place where user-provided data is incorporated into SQL queries.

Consider this vulnerable ASP.NET Core code snippet:

```csharp
public IActionResult GetUser(string username)
{
    // Vulnerable SQL query
    string query = "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Username = '" + username + "'";
    
    // Execute the query
    var user = _dbContext.Users.FromSqlRaw(query).FirstOrDefault();
    
    // ...
}
```

In this code, the `username` parameter is directly concatenated into the SQL query string, making it susceptible to SQL injection. An attacker could input malicious SQL code into the `username` field and compromise the database.

### Prevention: Parameterized Queries

To defend against SQL injection, always use parameterized queries or an ORM like Entity Framework Core. Here's a secure version of the code:

```csharp
public IActionResult GetUser(string username)
{
    var user = _dbContext.Users
        .FromSqlInterpolated($"SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Username = {username}")
        .FirstOrDefault();
    
    // ...
}
```

With parameterized queries, user input is treated as data, not executable code. This approach safeguards your application against SQL injection attacks.

## Command Injection: Executing System Commands

Command injection is another injection attack vector where attackers exploit applications that execute system commands. They inject malicious command-line instructions into user inputs, tricking the application into running unauthorized commands on the host system.

### Vulnerable Code Example:

```csharp
public IActionResult ExecuteCommand(string input)
{
    // Vulnerable command execution
    var process = new Process
    {
        StartInfo = new ProcessStartInfo
        {
            FileName = "cmd.exe",
            Arguments = "/C " + input,
            RedirectStandardOutput = true,
            UseShellExecute = false,
            CreateNoWindow = true
        }
    };
    
    process.Start();
    string result = process.StandardOutput.ReadToEnd();
    process.WaitForExit();
    
    return Content(result);
}
```

In this code, the `input` variable is directly concatenated into the command, making it susceptible to command injection. An attacker could inject malicious commands, potentially compromising the host system.

### Prevention: Input Validation and Safe Execution

To prevent command injection, validate and sanitize user input, and use safe execution mechanisms. Here's an example:

```csharp
public IActionResult ExecuteCommand(string input)
{
    // Safe command execution
    if (!string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(input) && input.All(char.IsLetterOrDigit))
    {
        // Execute the command
        // ...
    }
    else
    {
        return BadRequest("Invalid input.");
    }
    
    // ...
}
```

By validating and sanitizing user input and restricting command execution to trusted operations, you can mitigate the risk of command injection attacks.

## CRLF Injection: Manipulating HTTP Requests

CRLF (Carriage Return Line Feed) injection attacks target HTTP requests and responses. Attackers inject special characters into user inputs to manipulate the headers and content of HTTP requests, potentially causing various issues on the server.

### Vulnerable Code Example:

```csharp
public IActionResult ProcessRequest(string input)
{
    // Vulnerable CRLF injection
    string response = "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n";
    response += "Content-Length: " + input.Length + "\r\n\r\n";
    response += input;
    
    return Content(response);
}
```

In this code, the `input` variable is incorporated into the HTTP response without proper validation, making it susceptible to CRLF injection. An attacker could inject malicious characters to alter the response headers.

### Prevention: Proper Input Validation and Output Encoding

To prevent CRLF injection, validate user inputs and use proper output encoding when constructing HTTP responses. Here's a secure version of the code:

```csharp
public IActionResult ProcessRequest(string input)
{
    // Secure CRLF prevention
    if (input.Contains("\r") || input.Contains("\n"))
    {
        return BadRequest("Invalid input.");
    }
    
    string response = "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n";
    response += "Content-Length: " + input.Length + "\r\n\r\n";
    response += input;
    
    return Content(response);
}
```

By properly validating and encoding user inputs, you can mitigate the risk of CRLF injection attacks.

## LDAP Injection: Manipulating LDAP Queries

LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) injection attacks target applications that interact with LDAP directories. Attackers inject malicious LDAP statements into user inputs, attempting to manipulate directory queries and potentially access sensitive data.

### Vulnerable Code Example:

```csharp
public IActionResult SearchUser(string username)
{
    // Vulnerable LDAP query
    string query = "(uid=" + username + ")";
    var entry = _ldapConnection.Search(query);
    
    // ...
}
```

In this code, the `username` parameter is directly concatenated into the LDAP query string, making it susceptible to LDAP injection. An attacker could input malicious LDAP statements, potentially compromising the LDAP directory.

### Prevention: Parameterized LDAP Queries

To prevent LDAP injection, use parameterized LDAP queries with proper input validation. Here's a secure version of the code:

```csharp
public IActionResult SearchUser(string username)
{
    // Secure LDAP query
    var searchFilter = new SearchFilter
    {
        Filter = $"(uid={username})"
    };
    
    var searchRequest = new SearchRequest("ou=users,dc=example,dc=com", searchFilter);
    var response = _ldapConnection.SendRequest(searchRequest) as SearchResponse;
    
    // ...
}
```

By using parameterized LDAP queries and validating user inputs, you can safeguard your application against LDAP injection attacks.

## Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and More

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) entails attackers injecting client-side code into web applications through input or text areas. This malicious code can then execute in the context of other users' browsers, potentially leading to data theft, session hijacking, and more.

### Understanding Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

In cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, attackers inject malicious scripts (usually JavaScript) into web pages viewed by other users. These scripts can steal sensitive information, manipulate web content, or perform actions on behalf of the victim user.

#### Reflected XSS

Reflected XSS occurs when an application includes unvalidated or unencoded user input in the HTML response. Attackers craft URLs containing malicious payloads, and when unsuspecting users click these links, the script executes in their browsers.

Here's a vulnerable ASP.NET Core

 code snippet that reflects user input without proper encoding:

```csharp
[HttpGet]
public IActionResult GreetUser(string name)
{
    ViewData["Greeting"] = $"Hello, {name}!";
    return View();
}
```

In this code, the `name` parameter is directly included in the HTML response without encoding, making it vulnerable to reflected XSS attacks.

### Prevention: Output Encoding

To prevent reflected XSS, always encode user-generated content before rendering it in HTML responses. In ASP.NET Core, you can use the `HtmlEncoder` class:

```csharp
[HttpGet]
public IActionResult GreetUser(string name)
{
    ViewData["Greeting"] = $"Hello, {HtmlEncoder.Default.Encode(name)}!";
    return View();
}
```

By encoding user inputs, you ensure that any injected scripts are treated as plain text, thwarting XSS attacks.

#### Stored XSS

Stored XSS occurs when an attacker stores a malicious script on a server, and this script is later served to other users who view the compromised page. It's particularly dangerous as it can affect multiple users.

Here's a vulnerable code snippet that stores and serves user input without proper encoding:

```csharp
[HttpPost]
public IActionResult PostComment(string comment)
{
    // Vulnerable code
    _commentService.SaveComment(comment);
    return RedirectToAction("Index");
}
```

In this code, user comments are stored without encoding, making it possible for an attacker to inject malicious scripts into comments.

### Prevention: Input Validation and Output Encoding

To prevent stored XSS, validate and sanitize user-generated content and always encode it when rendering in HTML responses. Here's a secure version of the code:

```csharp
[HttpPost]
public IActionResult PostComment(string comment)
{
    // Secure code
    var sanitizedComment = HtmlEncoder.Default.Encode(comment);
    _commentService.SaveComment(sanitizedComment);
    return RedirectToAction("Index");
}
```

By validating, sanitizing, and encoding user inputs, you can protect your application against stored XSS attacks.
